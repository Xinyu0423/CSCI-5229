# Hw2: Scene in 3D
## Author: Xinyu Jiang

## Instruction to Run
* Use `make` command to compile the code and run the hw2 file
* Use `make clean` command to clean the compiled program

## Instructions to Graders
* Type `m` to switch modes: Overhead orthogonal (default),Overhead perspective,First person perspective
* Type `0` to reset all views(start up)
* Type `.` to check the main view
* Type `x` to toggle axes.
* Type `-` to decrease `fov` value.
* Type `+` to increase `fov` value.
* In `First person perspective`: 
  * Type `a`, `w`, `s`, `d` to change the movement. 
  * Type `j`, `k`, `i`, `l` to change the view angle.
* Use `Upward Arrow` or `Downward arrow` to increase or decrease angle in z axis(not able to use in first person perspective).
* Use `Left Arrow`  or `Right Arrow` to increase or decrease in x axis(not able to use in first person perspective).
* Use `Page up` or `Page down` to zoom in and out.
